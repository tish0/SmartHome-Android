Smart Home app
This app which I developed during my Android course in Algonquin College.
It is smart home app. With it you can open/close a garage door.
Turn on/off light in the garage. When You open the door the light is On automatically.
You can Set the temperature in the house. I am using two sppiners one for the day array and one 
for the degrees. After that we get output in array list. Also when you go to wheather button you can see
the actual temperature outside and refresh it.

Thanks,
Tish
